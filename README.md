## Hi there im Rodrigo Peetz, also known as rdxdt👋

I'm a developer altough i have a MTA certification on Software Development Fundamentals i'm not too keen on Microsoft stuff.

I speak Brazilian Portuguese(pt-BR) and English(en-US), i can mostly make sense of Spanish.

Yeah yeah, i know i need to put more stuff here and publish some of my repositories and projects, but right now i'm slowly trying to sort my online presence out.

## 👨🏻 About me 
- 💻 I’m currently working at [@PlanosInformatica](https://github.com/PlanosInformatica/) as a developer (doing it since 2013, it has been a while) of ERP and POS software.
- 🤝🏻 I’m looking to collaborate on FOSS projects...
- 🎓 I have a law degree too (i know this is kind of unrelated to my field of work, but hey knowledge is always welcome).
- 🔒 I'm a bit obsessed and kind of paranoid with operational security and privacy.
- 🎸 I'm your average guitar player, altough lately i'm not active on this hobbie
- 💾 I miss the old days where the internet were more decentralized and had more communities outside big tech spaces like reddit and stuff, good old days where vBulletin,IPB and phpBB forums were all the rage.
- 📺 I love retro gaming, and i currently own in my collection a Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1, a 486 PC, about two Socket 7 systems (Pentium MMX 166, AMD K6-2 500), my good old Athlon XP 2400+ that i had since my early teen years, and enough socket 775 systems to host my own lan party (and i have done it not so long ago 😅)
